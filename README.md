# Azure Threat Modeling Project

This project demonstrates application threat modeling using Microsoft’s Threat Modeling Tool (TMT 7) to identify, document, and mitigate security risks in a cloud-based web application. It includes attack surface analysis, data flow mapping, and identified mitigations aligned with Azure workloads. The project highlights the ability to apply security best practices in cloud environments and effectively communicate risks through a structured threat modeling approach.

#  Objectives
- Model a web application’s architecture using TMT 7.
- Identify potential threats across data flows, trust boundaries, and assets.
- Propose mitigations aligned with Azure security best practices.
- Document findings for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

#  Deliverables
- TMT file with full threat model.
- Exported threat model report (PDF).
- Diagram of application architecture.
- Mitigation strategies documented per STRIDE category.

#  Tools Used
- Microsoft TMT 7
- Azure Security Best Practices
- STRIDE methodology

#  Outcomes
This project shows my ability to:
- Apply structured threat modeling techniques.
- Translate identified risks into actionable mitigations.
- Communicate findings clearly for review and decision-making.

#  Next Steps
- Expand threat modeling to multi-tier or microservices architectures.
- Integrate threat model updates into CI/CD workflows.
- Explore automation with security scanning tools.
